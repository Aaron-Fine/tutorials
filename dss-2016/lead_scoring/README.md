Lead Scoring
============

Prioritizing new leads is critical for sales and marketing teams. Modern
machine learning methods use historical data and state of the art classifiers
to learn a probabilistic relationship between sales account features and
conversion outcome, enabling us to predict with very high accuracy which open
accounts are likely to convert. This improvement in accuracy translates
directly into more efficient use of sales and marketing resources.

In this tutorial, I'll discuss the major themes in predictive lead scoring and
walk through Python code for building a lead scoring application. The demo uses
Turi's new Lead Scoring Toolkit, but the focus is on the design and
implementation principles for the lead scoring task.
