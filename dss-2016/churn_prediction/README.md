Churn Prediction 
=================

User-activity data records typically contain user actions performed on a
 website, service, or product. These user activity transactions tell us a lot
 about the user's current interests & preferences. Knowing these interests and
 preferences can help make businesses make better decisions. 

 Recommender systems, fraud detection, churn prediction, and lead scoring are
 examples of data products that can require user-activity data. In this
 two-part tutorial, you will first learn how to work with user activity data
 and then learn about two specific examples of applications that can leverage
 user activity data; churn prediction & lead scoring;

 Churn prediction is the task of identifying users that are likely to stop
 using a service, product or website. Lead scoring is the task of prioritizing
 users based on the probability that are likely to start using a service,
 product or website. In the first part of the tutorial, you will learn to:
 - Train a model to forecast user churn
 - Explore & Evaluate predictions made by the model
 - Consume predictions made by the model in an external application
