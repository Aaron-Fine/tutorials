Deep Learning 
=============

Deep Learning methods have been driving state-of-the-art results in computer
vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. This is important
in areas such as face detection, photo organization, and machine language
translation. As a result, user experiences for applications have improved
dramatically.  

In this tutorial, I'll be deconstructing an image application using GraphLab
Create, and introducing Deep Learning concepts in the process. The focus will
be more on practical usage and less on theory.
